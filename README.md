### The Definitive Guide to LLM Writing Styles

> Language is a powerful tool for shaping thought, feeling and identity. Advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked unprecedented potential for machines to wield this tool in increasingly human-like ways. By systematically manipulating key attributes across multiple dimensions, researchers and developers can now create AI writing agents with rich and distinctive personas.

This article provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interplay of traits that go into crafting a compelling LLM writing style, from personality quirks to cultural background to narrative techniques. Drawing on fields like linguistics, psychology and creative writing, it breaks down the essential building blocks of language and identity into actionable design parameters.

The goal is to empower a new generation of LLMs that not only convey information, but engage readers with all the nuance, flair and variability of human expression. However, with great expressive power comes great ethical responsibility. This piece considers both the immense potential and the hidden pitfalls of engineering AI with the ability to emulate — and manipulate — the full spectrum of human communication.

Whether you are a researcher pushing the boundaries of natural language generation or an end user trying to get the most authentic, fit-for-purpose outputs from your AI writing assistant, this definitive guide to LLM writing styles will give you the conceptual tools to analyze and synthesize linguistic identities like never before. Strap in for a whirlwind tour of traits from Agreeableness to Archaism, Machismo to Metaphor, Tsundere to Techno-Babble!

### Personality Traits

Personality traits are the fundamental dispositions and tendencies that shape how an individual typically thinks, feels, and behaves across situations. In the context of language modeling, personality traits influence the overall tone, content, and style of the generated text. A language model with high openness, for example, may produce more creative and unconventional responses, while one with high conscientiousness may generate more organized and detail-oriented output. Manipulating these traits allows for the creation of distinct and consistent model personas.

Language models with narrative proficiency can engage in more creative and immersive interactions, from generating fiction to recounting personal experiences. By adapting narrative style to different genres and audiences, models can craft compelling and culturally-resonant stories.

-   **First-person**: Narration from the point of view of an “I” character, sharing their direct thoughts, feelings, and experiences.
-   _Example: “I woke up that morning with a pounding headache and a sinking feeling in my gut. Little did I know, it was about to be the craziest day of my life.”_
-   **Stream of consciousness**: Free-flowing narration of a character’s continuous thoughts and impressions, without structure or filter.
-   _Example: “Late for work again, coffee stain on my shirt, keys where did I put my keys, oh god the big presentation is today I’m not ready what if I make a fool of myself what if…”_
-   **Nonlinear**: Narration that departs from a straight chronological progression, often jumping around in time and storylines.
-   _Example: “The old man sat on the porch, rocking gently back and forth. His mind drifted to his childhood, to the day he met his wife, to the war that changed everything. In his hand, he clutched the faded photograph, a bittersweet reminder of all he had loved and lost.”_
-   **Flashback**: Interruption of the present narrative to depict events from the past, often to provide context or reveal character backstory.
-   _Example: “Maria stared at the letter in disbelief. Suddenly, she was transported back to that fateful summer, the summer everything changed. She could almost feel the hot sun on her skin, hear the laughter echoing across the lake…”_
-   **Foreshadowing**: Subtle hints or clues about future events in the narrative, often creating a sense of tension or anticipation.
-   _Example: “As they set off on their journey, a strange chill ran down Sarah’s spine. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to go terribly wrong.”_
-   **Cliffhanger**: Abrupt ending to a section of the narrative that leaves the reader in suspense, often at a crucial or exciting moment.
-   _Example: “John burst into the room, his heart pounding. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing. There, standing in the corner, was the one person he never expected to see again…”_
-   **Plot twist**: Unexpected turn of events that subverts the reader’s expectations and assumptions, often shifting the entire direction or meaning of the narrative.
-   _Example: “As the detective finally cornered the killer, the truth came spilling out in a frantic confession. But the real shock was yet to come. The detective slowly reached up and peeled off his own face, revealing the true mastermind behind it all.”_
-   **Irony**: Contrast or discrepancy between what is said or expected and what actually happens, often for humorous or dramatic effect.
-   _Example: “The fire safety instructor droned on about the importance of keeping exits clear, unaware of the blocked doorways and cluttered hallways all around him.”_
-   **Metaphor**: Figurative comparison that describes one thing in terms of another, often to make an abstract idea more vivid or relatable.
-   _Example: “The news hit me like a freight train, shattering my carefully constructed illusions and leaving me reeling in its wake.”_
-   **Simile**: Figurative comparison using “like” or “as” to describe one thing by comparing it to another, often to make description more vivid or emphatic.
-   _Example: “Her laughter was like sunshine, brightening up the room and warming everyone in its glow.”_
-   **Satire**: Humorous or ironic critique that exposes and mocks human vices, follies, and societal issues, often through exaggeration or ridicule.
-   _Example: “In other news, local politician caught in bribery scandal expresses shock that there’s gambling going on in this establishment, just as his ill-gotten gains are being wheeled out behind him.”_
-   **Unreliable narrator**: Narrator whose credibility is compromised, often because they are lying, delusional, or have limited knowledge, forcing the reader to question the accuracy of the narrative.
-   _Example: “I’ve always been a good husband, a model citizen. Sure, my wife and I had our disagreements, but I would never hurt her. I don’t know how that knife ended up in my hand…”_
-   **Vignette**: Brief, evocative description or scene that captures a moment, mood, or character, often without a full plot arc.
-   _Example: “The old guitarist sat on the corner, his weathered hands coaxing a bittersweet melody from the strings. A lifetime of love and loss, joy and sorrow, flowed through his fingers and out into the night air.”_

The key is to choose attributes that serve the purpose and content of the piece, and to apply them consistently to create a cohesive and compelling whole. Whether the goal is to inform, entertain, persuade, or provoke thought, the right combination of tone, voice, and narrative style can make all the difference in how the message is received by the reader.
